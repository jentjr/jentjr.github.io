      <description>Hadley Wickham recently started an R package for reading excel files called readxl. The package has no external dependencies, which makes it easy to install. If you have worked with other packages for reading excel files like XLConnect, which uses java, it might not be straightforward to get the package working. For example, you might have to reconfigure java on your computer by running command below in your terminal.
sudo R CMD javareconf  The syntax in readxl is much cleaner and straightforward than some of the other packages for reading excel files, which makes it much nicer to use.</description>
